* To create python virtual environment --> python3 -m venv .venv

    USED TO ISOLATE THE DEPENDENCIES FOR THE APLLICATION

* migration represents the data structure for the databases.    
    python manage.py migrate (for creating essential database tables)

* we have admin panel pre built to watch over our models 
    to access the admin panel --> python3 manage.py createsuperuser

* serializer will help to conver python from the json    



















 ** Steps to create the Api **
1. create directory -> mkdir project_name

2. create an virtual environment -> python3 -m venv .venv 
    and activate this using . .venv/bin/activate

3. install django in the folder like -> pip insatll django   

4.  create your app in the same directory using -> django-admin startproject pro_name . (current dir)
    Now test your server by running -> python3 manage.py runserver

5. run python3 manage.py migrate to get the databse tables.(admin panel accessible via urls)

6. run python3 manage.py createsuperuser for admin dashboarda.
    _________________******************____________________

7. Model :- To create our own table in the database we need models
            * create new "models.py" in you project dir not folder
            * get this, from django.db import models
            * Now create a class say xyz and inherit if from djangoModels class
                like class xyz(models.Model)
            * Now you can add atrributes to the table like we have in sql 
                ex->  fname  =  models.CharField(max_length=50)
                      lname = models.CharField(max_length=50)  

8. imp : before doing anything else add your app name in the setting.py
        like ->   INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'app_name',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    .......
]


9. Now after all this we again need to do the migrations as we have added new model
        run python3 manage.py makemigrations project_name
        then run python3 manage.py migrate                     

10. as we have made the migration
     but there will be no change in the admin panel
     so we will create a new file "admin.py" in app dir
     and then we register the table in admin :- 
        from django.contrib import admin
        from .models import model_name


        admin.site.register(model_name)

    ** ADD SOME TABLE IN THE DATABASE VIA ADMIN DASHBOARD **
   _________________________________________

    **    MODEL IS CREATED NOW WE MAKE SERIALIZER **

 11. now we are going to create the api for our app
     install rest framework by running  -> pip install djangorestframework

12. write this in your seetings.py
        like -> INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'rest_framework',
    'app_name',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    ...
]

13. Now create serializer file after this
        * This file will describe how to go from python object to json
        steps : 
            * import serializer from rest_framework like from rest_framework import serializers
            * now create a class and inherit it from serializer like 
                class name(serializers.ModelSerializer) 
            * now create a inner class Meta which will 
              describe the model of the table we have created   
            * we need to import our model say "model_xyz"
              and inside Meta we write
              model = model_xyz
            * and we will now write fields beneath it 
              so we do, from dataclasses import fields
              and write fields = ['id', 'fname', 'lname']   

 ____________________________________________________________________

    ***    TILL NOW WE HAVE MODEL AND SERIALIZER, NOW WE CRAETE ENDPOINTS ***

 14.  now we have to return the data via endpoints

 15. create a new file name "views.py" in app folder

 16. And we are going to write various functions here which 
     which will be invoked by the end points 
     like wwww.aman.com/name
     so name function will be invoked

    def name(request) :
    # In this function we need to :
    # get all the drinks
    # serialize them 
    # return json
      
 17. before that we need to import some stuff like
        * from django.http import JsonResponse to send json data

        * from .models import model_xyz to get the models

        * from .serializers import OfficeSerializers 
          to serialize the data 

18. inside the function we write 

    -> office = Office.objects.all() "To get all the model objects"

    -> serializer = OfficeSerializers(office, many =True) "To serialize all the offcie objects"

    -> return JsonResponse(serializer.data, safe=False)  "To return the json"


____________________________________________________    

    ** WE HAVE EVERYHING MODEL, SERIALIZER AND OUR VIEWS ***

19. Now we just have to tell that which url will hit the function inside the view

20. so we go to urls.py and add our path like :-
    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls), # default
        path('name',views.name, name = 'name'),
    ]


    **** run the server using python3 manage.py runserver and wallaah ****
